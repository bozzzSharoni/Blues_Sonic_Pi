# Blues_Sonic_Pi

"Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on Ruby, originally designed to support both computing and music lessons in schools, developed by Sam Aaron in the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in collaboration with Raspberry Pi Foundation." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Pi

# Background

I play the guitar since the age of 9 and taught myself over the years also basic drumming, keyboards, and I also have basic knowledge of how to use DAWs such as Ableton live and Cubase.

Not so long ago(actually just 7 hours ago), I have discovered the idea of live coding and found it fascinating, especially because I discovered Sonic Pi.

The idea of using a live coding enviorment to make music was like discovering a new continent for me.

Even though this code is pretty basic and even a bit "dirty" looking, I think it sets a good example of what can be achived with pretty basic knowledge of the Sonic Pi enviorment.

I never programmed in Ruby before but my knowledge in programming was pretty helpful and the Sonic Pi manual is very friendly.

I belive this kind of music making tools have a far greater potential than what was achived up until this point.

I find it sad that this form of art is not as popular yet as other forms of electronic music.

One thing I didn`t utilized(yet), is the fact that in Sonic Pi you can actually go deeper than the western 12 tone system, and use microtonality in a pretty easy way.

I will leave at the end of this Readme file, links to more Sonic Pi material and also a link to a youtube page of a British musician named "Sevish" who trully tries to expand the limits
of music with the new advantages that computer technology gives us.

I will also leave a WAV file so you can download a demo of how the music from the code sounds like.

# Musical Background

For those who might not no how my code works musically, I`ll live links to wikipedia articles about the topics relevant to this basic piece here:
